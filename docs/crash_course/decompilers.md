# `.bsp` Decompiling

Decompiling is the process of reversing a `.bsp` into an editor file.
This can be useful for study, debugging & even data recovery.
However, decompiling entails a few legal & social issues.


## Theft

If anyone can decompile any map, anyone can take someone else's hard work & "make it theirs" with minor effort.
Just a few cases of map theft can seriously burn out creators, leaving only the "map flippers".
Any decompiling project needs to grapple with the fact that Terms of Use aren't going to stop theft.


## Ownership

As mentioned above, decompilation can confuse the history of a map & leave creators alienated from their work.
Modern large mapping communities, being close to the paid Game Development Industry, generally ban decompiling.
In younger & smaller mapping communities, decompiling could cause massive social damage.
These communities are quite fragile, though partnering with a larger, general mapping community can help.

`bsp_tool` is going to have a hard time when it comes to decompiling.
Reversing the full, detailed compile process involves decompiling, which could lead to making compilers.
However, this would mean new mapping communities would be built on edits to Official maps.[^mp_amogus]
