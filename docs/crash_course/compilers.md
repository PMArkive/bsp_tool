# `.bsp` Compile Process

## Core stages

The Official way to make a `.bsp` file is via a level editor.
Level editors save your work to a `.map` or `.vmf`

> NOTE: Some editors like `J.A.C.K.` or Half-Life's Hammer use other formats (`.jmf` & `.rmf`)

These files are made up of plaintext defining brushwork, other static geometry & entities

> NOTE: Not all entities make it into a compiled `.vmf` as entities, they are consumed by the compile process

> NOTE: Some formats also store editor session state
